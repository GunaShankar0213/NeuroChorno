        "stage1_quantitative": "The patient exhibits significant atrophy primarily in the entorhinal cortex (-5.707%/year, Z = -3.923) and hippocampus (-1.44%/year, Z = -0.299), with some involvement of the temporal lobe (-1.545%/year, Z = -1.064). The parietal lobe shows relatively normal change (-0.45%/year, Z = 0.249), and ventricles demonstrate slight enlargement (+0.634%/year, Z = -0.866). Given the strong negative Z-scores for the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, coupled with the 'Entorhinal atrophy Z < -1.5' rule triggering a 'Normal Progression' classification with a score of 1, this suggests a slower rate of neurodegeneration compared to what might be expected given the severity of the entorhinal atrophy. This could indicate a less aggressive disease course or a more resilient individual.",
        "stage2_multimodal": "The visual input confirms the quantitative findings regarding atrophy in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. The Jacobian overlay displays \"cool/blue\" hues in these regions, corresponding to the reported negative Z-scores indicating atrophy. There are no apparent visual artifacts that contradict the numerical data presented in the previous analysis. Therefore, the visual evidence supports the quantitative metrics.",
