The ventricles demonstrate substantial enlargement (13.18%/year, Z = 11.68). The automated classification of \"Normal Progression\" appears appropriate given the relatively mild atrophy in the hippocampus and temporal lobe, coupled with the prominent ventricular enlargement. The Z-score for the ventricles being greater than +2.0 triggers the rule for \"Fast Progressor,\" indicating a more rapid rate of ventricular expansion compared to normal aging.",
        "stage2_multimodal": "The visual input shows a \"cool/blue\" appearance in the Hippocampus region, corresponding to the reported negative Z-score of -0.145%/year. The Jacobian overlay also displays \"cool/blue\" colors in the Parietal Lobe, aligning with the reported negative Z-score of -0.684%/year. There are no obvious visual anomalies that contradict the quantitative data. Therefore, the visual evidence supports the quantitative metrics.",
