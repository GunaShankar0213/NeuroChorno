2026-02-16 15:24:56,151 | DEBUG | Stage 1 — Quantitative Interpretation raw output:
The patient exhibits significant atrophy primarily in the Entorhinal Cortex (-1.101%/year, Z = -0.084) and Parietal Lobe (-0.684%/year, Z = -0.139), with less pronounced change in the Hippocampus (-0.145%/year, Z = 1.319) and Temporal Lobe (0.024%/year, Z = 1.177). The ventricles demonstrate substantial enlargement (13.18%/year, Z = 11.68). The automated classification of "Normal Progression" appears appropriate given the relatively mild atrophy in the hippocampus and temporal lobe, coupled with the prominent ventricular enlargement. The Z-score for the ventricles being greater than +2.0 triggers the rule for "Fast Progressor," indicating a more rapid rate of ventricular expansion compared to normal aging.

2026-02-16 15:25:28,694 | DEBUG | Stage 2 — Multimodal Integration raw output:
The visual input shows a "cool/blue" appearance in the Hippocampus region, corresponding to the reported negative Z-score of -0.145%/year. The Jacobian overlay also displays "cool/blue" colors in the Parietal Lobe, aligning with the reported negative Z-score of -0.684%/year. There are no obvious visual anomalies that contradict the quantitative data. Therefore, the visual evidence supports the quantitative metrics.
