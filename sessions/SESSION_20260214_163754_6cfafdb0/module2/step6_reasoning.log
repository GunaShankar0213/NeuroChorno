2026-02-14 16:46:01,455 | DEBUG | Stage 1 — Quantitative Interpretation raw output:
Significant atrophy is observed in the Entorhinal Cortex (-5.32%/year, Z = -3.6) and Hippocampus (-1.592%/year, Z = -0.49), with temporal lobe atrophy also present (-1.523%/year, Z = -1.033). The patient exhibits a predominantly entorhinal atrophy pattern. Given the negative Z-scores for the Entorhinal Cortex and Hippocampus, coupled with the normal progression classification, this suggests a relatively slow rate of neurodegeneration compared to a fast progressor.

2026-02-14 16:46:33,212 | DEBUG | Stage 2 — Multimodal Integration raw output:
The Jacobian overlay shows significant atrophy in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, consistent with the reported Z-scores of -0.49 and -3.6 respectively. The blue/cool color scheme aligns with the expected pattern of atrophy indicated by the negative Z-scores. There are no obvious visual artifacts that contradict the quantitative data. Therefore, the visual evidence supports the quantitative metrics.

**Finalized Narrative Summary:**

Significant atrophy is observed in the Entorhinal Cortex (-5.32%/year, Z = -3.6) and Hippocampus (-1.592%/year, Z = -0.49), with temporal lobe atrophy also present (-1.523%/year, Z = -1.033). The patient exhibits a predominantly entorhinal atrophy pattern. Given the negative Z-scores for the Entorhinal Cortex and Hippocampus, coupled with the normal progression classification, this suggests a relatively slow rate of neurodegeneration compared to a fast progressor.
