The patient exhibits a predominantly entorhinal atrophy pattern. Given the negative Z-scores for the Entorhinal Cortex and Hippocampus, coupled with the normal progression classification, this suggests a relatively slow rate of neurodegeneration compared to a fast progressor.",

The blue/cool color scheme aligns with the expected pattern of atrophy indicated by the negative Z-scores. There are no obvious visual artifacts that contradict the quantitative data. Therefore, the visual evidence supports the quantitative metrics.",
